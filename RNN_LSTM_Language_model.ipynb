        "# Building Recurrent neural network (RNN)\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory.\" They can read inputs (such as words) one at a time, and remember some contextual information through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time step to the next. This allows a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional (two-way) RNN can take context from both the past and the future, much like Marty McFly. \n",
