# Sequence_models
this repository contains step by step guides to implement some of the state of the art sequence models 
it starts with a notebook highlighting the details of basic Recurrent neural network with a from scratch implementation, followed by a brief introduciton 
and highlight of LSTM building gates and their roles regulating the information flow and solving the vanishing gradient problem. 

In the notebook we also present an entertaining appplication of RNN to build a character level language model aiming to predict new dinausore breed names.
